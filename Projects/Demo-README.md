## 🎯 Lab Overview  
- **Duration**: 1 hour 30 minutes  
- **Level**: Introductory  
- **Focus**: Cybersecurity, compliance, and cloud storage remediation using **Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC)**.  

Reports highlight vulnerabilities, issues, or non-compliance with standards. Acting on them helps mitigate risks, prevent breaches, and strengthen overall security posture.

## 🏦 Scenario  
You are a **junior cloud security analyst at Cymbal Bank**.  
Your task: Remediate findings reported by the **Security Command Center (SCC)** regarding a **misconfigured Cloud Storage bucket**.  

**Threats identified:**  
- Sensitive documents stored in a **publicly accessible bucket**.  
- **Uniform bucket-level access disabled**.  
- **Bucket logging disabled** (low risk, not required to remediate in this lab).  

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions  
1. Launch the lab from Coursera → Qwiklabs.  
2. Open **Google Cloud Console** in an **Incognito Window**.  
3. Log in with **temporary credentials** provided in the Lab Details panel.  
   - Accept terms.  
   - Do **not** add recovery options or free trials.

## 🔍 Task 1: Identify Vulnerabilities with SCC  
1. In the **Google Cloud Console**, go to:  
   `Navigation Menu → Security → Overview`  
2. Open **Vulnerabilities** to review findings.  

**Key Active Findings**:  
- **PUBLIC_BUCKET_ACL** → Bucket is publicly accessible (High risk 🚨).  
- **BUCKET_POLICY_ONLY_DISABLED** → Uniform bucket access disabled (Medium risk ⚠️).  
- **BUCKET_LOGGING_DISABLED** → Logging disabled (Low risk ℹ️).

## 🔧 Task 2: Remediate Vulnerabilities  

### 1. Remove Public Access  
- Go to: `Cloud Storage → Buckets → [Your Bucket] → Permissions`.  
- Expand **Storage Object Viewer** role.  
- Remove **allUsers**.

### 3. Verify Remediation  
- Return to **Security → Compliance → CIS GCP Foundation 2.0 Report**.  
- Confirm that active findings for:  
  - *Public bucket ACL* = **0**  
  - *Bucket policy only disabled* = **0**
