# Project Title: Phishing Incident Timeline Documentation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Scenario

On October 12, 2023, Cymbal Bank experienced its first severe phishing
attempt since adopting cloud services.\
An employee received a phishing email disguised as an authentication
request, clicked the malicious link, and submitted credentials into a
fake form.\
The attacker immediately used the stolen credentials to access multiple
applications, triggering alerts and suspicious activity logs.\
This scenario highlights the speed at which phishing incidents escalate
and the importance of effective detection, response, and prevention
measures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to document and visually present the
timeline of a phishing incident at Cymbal Bank. This documentation
ensures that executive stakeholders clearly understand the sequence of
events, the speed at which the incident unfolded, and the importance of
reinforcing security awareness and response processes.

## Project Description

On **October 12, 2023**, Cymbal Bank faced its first severe phishing
attempt after adopting cloud services. The attack unfolded rapidly, with
every minute escalating the risk. Below is a **step-by-step visual
walk-through** of the incident:

-   **11:45 a.m. -- The Hook is Set**\
    The user receives a phishing email. It appears authentic, disguised
    as a routine authentication request, but it contains a malicious
    link.

-   **11:46 a.m. -- The Click**\
    The user, believing the email is legitimate, clicks on the phishing
    link. This action opens a fraudulent web page crafted to mimic a
    trusted login portal.

-   **11:47 a.m. -- The Credentials Stolen**\
    The user submits their cloud login credentials into the fake form.
    Instantly, the attacker captures these details, gaining the keys to
    the bank's cloud services.

-   **11:48 a.m. -- The Alarm Sounds**\
    Cymbal Bank's security systems detect an unusual login attempt: a
    new device connecting from an unfamiliar location. A high-severity
    alert is triggered, flagging potential compromise.

-   **11:49 a.m. -- The Breach Expands**\
    Within seconds, the attacker leverages the stolen credentials to log
    into **four separate applications**. Suspicious activities spike
    across multiple platforms, confirming unauthorized access.

This **five-minute chain of events** illustrates how quickly a phishing
attack can escalate from a single email to widespread unauthorized
access.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Conclusion

This incident highlights the critical importance of **speed in detection
and response**. The attacker successfully compromised credentials and
accessed multiple systems within minutes.

**Key Lessons Learned:**\
- **Employee vigilance** is the first line of defense --- phishing
awareness training must be strengthened.\
- **Real-time monitoring** and automated alerts are essential to flag
suspicious behavior immediately.\
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** should be enforced to prevent
stolen credentials from being enough for account compromise.

By applying these lessons, Cymbal Bank can improve resilience, protect
customer data, and strengthen trust in its cloud security.
