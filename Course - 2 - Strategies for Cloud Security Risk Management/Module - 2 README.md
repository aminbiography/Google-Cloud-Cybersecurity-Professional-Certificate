# Cloud Security, Compliance, and Risk Management

---

## Risk Management Frameworks
- A **risk management framework** helps identify, assess, and manage security risks using structured practices and technologies.
- Common frameworks:
  - **NIST CSF** (Cybersecurity Framework)
  - **NIST Privacy Framework**
  - **ISO 27001**
  - **SOC 2**
  - **CIS Controls**
- **Combined frameworks** (e.g., NIST + SOC 2, HITRUST) support audits across multiple standards.

## Data Privacy vs. Data Protection
- **Data Privacy**:
  - Focuses on individual control over data access and usage.
  - Examples: declining cookies, disabling app location access.
- **Data Protection**:
  - Involves implementing security controls (encryption, access control) to safeguard data.
- Data protection is necessary to **meet privacy obligations**.

---

## Legal and Regulatory Compliance
- **HIPAA**: U.S. law for protecting **PHI** in healthcare.
- **GDPR**: EU regulation for privacy and data protection.
- **CPRA**: California state law for consumer data rights.
- **PIPEDA**: Canadian federal privacy law.
- **FedRAMP**: U.S. federal cloud security compliance.
- **PCI DSS**: Payment data security standard enforced by card brands.

## Standards and Security Controls
- **ISO 27001**:
  - Focuses on the **CIA Triad**:
    - **Confidentiality**: Only authorized access.
    - **Integrity**: Preventing unauthorized changes.
    - **Availability**: Ensuring data is accessible when needed.
- **PCI DSS**:
  - Applies to any organization handling cardholder data.
  - Compliance levels are based on annual transaction volume.
  - Three key steps: **Assess &rarr; Repair &rarr; Report**.

## Tools for Risk and Compliance
- **Google Cloud Risk Manager**:
  - Provides insight into technical risk posture.
  - Integrates with **Security Command Center**.
  - Supports cyber insurance eligibility using **CIS benchmarks**.
  - Allows organizations to create, approve, and share risk reports.

---

## Application in Real-world Scenarios
- To select the right framework, ask:
  - What **regulations** apply to our industry?
  - What **type of data** (e.g., PHI, PII, financial) are we handling?
  - What **jurisdictions** do we operate in?
  - Do we work with **government agencies**?
- Frameworks help **map controls**, align with legal obligations, and reduce risk.
