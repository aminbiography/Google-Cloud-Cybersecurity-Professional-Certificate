# Cloud Security & Compliance

---

## Topics Covered

### Security & Compliance Overview
- **Security**: Protects systems from threats; ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Compliance**: Adherence to internal/external regulations (e.g., HIPAA, NIST, SOC 2).
- **Difference**: Security protects, compliance proves protection.

### Security Domains (ISC² CCSP)
1. **Cloud Concepts, Architecture, and Design**
2. **Cloud Data Security**
3. **Cloud Platform and Infrastructure Security**
4. **Cloud Application Security**
5. **Cloud Security Operations**
6. **Legal, Risk, and Compliance**

### Risk & Threat Management
- **Threat**: Circumstance that could harm assets.
- **Vulnerability**: Weakness that can be exploited.
- **Risk**: Likelihood × Impact of a threat.
- **Residual Risk**: Remaining risk after controls are applied.
- **Risk Appetite**: Maximum risk the organization can accept.

### Security Controls
- **Types of Controls**:
  - *Technical*: Encryption, firewalls, MFA
  - *Administrative*: Policies, procedures
  - *Physical*: Locks, biometric access
- **Control Mapping**: Align controls to frameworks like NIST CSF or ISO 27001.

### PPT Framework
- **People**: Training, awareness, access roles
- **Process**: Policies, threat modeling, incident response
- **Technology**: Security tools, cloud configurations

### Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC)
- Centralized vulnerability and threat reporting tool.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Threat Prevention**
  - **Threat Detection**
  - **Attack Path Simulation**

---

### Security Control Implementation Steps
1. **Identify Controls** (via Threat Modeling)
2. **Develop Implementation Plan**
3. **Test and Validate Controls**
4. **Monitor and Maintain**
5. **Document in Security Plan**

---

### Compliance Frameworks
- **NIST CSF** – Functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- **SOC 2** – Trust Services Criteria: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy
- **HIPAA** – Protects Personal Health Information (PHI)
- **HITRUST** – Prescriptive controls aligned with healthcare regulations
- **PCI DSS** – Standards for securing cardholder data
