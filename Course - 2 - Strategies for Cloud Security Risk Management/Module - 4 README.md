# Cloud Security & Risk Management

## Cloud Security Foundations
- **Security Domains:** Key areas include IAM, network security, data protection, monitoring.
- **Cloud Organizational Policy:** Restrictions/constraints on cloud services to enforce compliance and security.
- **IAM vs. Org Policy:**
  - IAM →&rarr; *Who* has access
  - Org Policy → *What* configurations are allowed

---

## Risk Management & Compliance
- **Risk Management Frameworks:** Help identify, assess, and manage security risks.
- **Compliance Lifecycle:**
  - Policy development
  - Control mapping
  - Assessment & audits
  - Ongoing compliance
- **Non-Compliance Risks:** Legal issues, data breaches, financial penalties.

---

## Security Tools & Controls
- **Security Command Center (SCC):** Centralized tool for monitoring vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Web Security Scanner & Cloud Armor:** Detects web app vulnerabilities; protects against DDoS and OWASP attacks.
- **Cloud Protection+:** Cyber insurance tailored to security posture via Risk Protection Program.

---

## Policy Enforcement Mechanisms
- **Boolean Constraints:** Enforce behaviors as `true` or `false`. (e.g., disable automatic role grants)
- **List Constraints:** Allow/disallow specific values (e.g., locations, domains).
- **Policy Inheritance:** Policies cascade from org → folder → project unless overridden.

---

## Risk Protection & Cyber Insurance
- **Cyber Insurance:** Covers financial losses, data recovery, legal/regulatory fees from cyber incidents.
- **Risk Protection Program:**
  - Uses Risk Manager report
  - Simplifies insurance underwriting
- **Underwriting:** Evaluates organization's risk to price policies accurately.

---

## Shared Responsibility vs. Shared Fate
- **Shared Responsibility Model:**
  - CSP secures infrastructure
  - Customer secures data/configurations
- **Shared Fate Model:**
  - CSPs collaborate continuously
  - Provide secure defaults, guidance, joint risk mitigation

---

## Credential & Secret Management Best Practices
- Use a **secret manager**
- Avoid **hardcoding secrets**
- Rotate keys regularly
- Enforce **least privilege**
- Enable **auditing & logging**

---

## Multicloud & CSPM
- **CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management):** Tools that monitor security settings and compliance.
- **Multicloud CSPM:** Unified security assessment across multiple cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

---

## Sovereign Clouds & Digital Sovereignty
- **Sovereign Cloud:** Data residency + compliance with national laws.
- **Digital Sovereignty:** Ensures data stays under jurisdictional control, protects citizen data, supports national security.
