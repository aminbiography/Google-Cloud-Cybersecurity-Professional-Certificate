# Cloud Security Recovery & BCDR (Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery)

### Recovery after Security Incidents

Recovery is essential for restoring business operations after a disaster. It involves quarantining threats, restoring data from backups, eliminating vulnerabilities, and ensuring systems function normally. Recovery is not just about restoring — it’s also about learning and improving from each incident.

### Post-Recovery Checks

After systems are restored, checks confirm everything is working:

* Monitor logs and alerts
* Run security scans
* Test applications and systems
* Perform manual verification
* Maintain a chain of custody for evidence to aid investigations

### Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR)

BCDR ensures operations continue during and after disasters. It includes:

* **Business Continuity (BC):** Keep operations running
* **Disaster Recovery (DR):** Restore critical systems after disruptions

Google Cloud provides BCDR tools like **Cloud Backup and DR, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and Load Balancing** to ensure data safety and fast recovery.

### BCDR Tools and Categories

* **On-premises BCDR tools:** Installed and run on local infrastructure.
* **Cloud-based BCDR tools:** Managed by cloud providers.

Common tools include backup and recovery utilities, automation tools (failover, failback, replication), and business continuity management solutions.

### Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)

DRPs are survival kits for organizations. Core components include:

* Roles and responsibilities
* Identifying critical systems, applications, and data
* Testing and optimization of strategies
* Risk assessments with **Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs)** and **Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)**

### Google Cloud DRP Design and Implementation

Google Cloud provides tools like Cloud Storage, Backup and DR, Spanner, Bigtable, Load Balancing, and Interconnect for DRP.

* **RPO** defines how much data loss is acceptable
* **RTO** defines acceptable downtime

DR Patterns: **Cold site, Warm site, Hot site** — each with different readiness levels.

### BCDR Plans and Responsibilities

Effective BCDR requires coordination:

* **Executive stakeholders:** Budgeting and strategy (e.g., CIO)
* **Operational stakeholders:** Implement and manage recovery
* **Technical stakeholders:** First-line defense and system recovery

### Stakeholder Communication

Clear and timely communication is critical, especially when regular channels are down. **Out-of-band communications** should be prepared to ensure teams coordinate during disasters.

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework

The **MITRE ATT&CK** framework is a globally recognized knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It provides a structured way to understand how attackers operate, which helps organizations strengthen both **prevention** and **recovery** strategies.

**Key Components:**

* **Tactics:** High-level attacker goals (e.g., persistence, privilege escalation, lateral movement).
* **Techniques:** Specific methods adversaries use to achieve their goals (e.g., credential dumping, phishing, remote service exploitation).
* **Sub-techniques:** More granular breakdowns of how techniques are implemented.
* **Mitigations:** Defensive strategies mapped to each technique.
* **Detections:** Guidance on logging, monitoring, and alerting to identify malicious activity.

**Why It Matters for Recovery & BCDR:**

* Enhances **incident response playbooks** by aligning with real-world attack patterns.
* Helps teams conduct **post-incident analysis**, identifying exploited vulnerabilities and mapping them to ATT&CK techniques.
* Supports **gap analysis** for defenses and monitoring tools.
* Strengthens **training and simulations**, ensuring teams practice realistic scenarios.

Incorporating MITRE ATT&CK into your BCDR and security operations ensures that recovery is not only reactive but also **proactive and adaptive**, preparing organizations for future threats.
