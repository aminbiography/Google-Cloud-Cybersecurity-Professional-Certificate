# Core Cloud Security Concepts

---

## Key Concepts

- **Cloud Computing**: Use of on-demand computing services over the internet.
- **Cloud Cybersecurity**: Practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cloud-based systems and data.
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Security responsibilities are divided between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the customer.

---

## Security Roles

- **Cloud Security Architect**: Designs and develops security controls.
- **Cloud Security Engineer**: Implements and manages secure cloud infrastructure.
- **Compliance Team**: Ensures adherence to laws, regulations, and standards.
- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: Detects and responds to cybersecurity incidents.

## DevSecOps & Automation

- **DevSecOps**: Integration of development, security, and operations for better collaboration and automation.
- - **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration (automated code testing/merging) and Continuous Delivery (automated deployment to staging/production).
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automating infrastructure management using code (e.g., Terraform).
- **Policy as Code (PaC)**: Defining and enforcing policies through code.

## Controls & Management

- **Cloud Security Controls**: Protective, detective, and responsive mechanisms to secure cloud systems.
- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Continuous monitoring and configuration of cloud environments for compliance.
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security to reduce vulnerabilities.
- **Firewall Rules**: Define allowed/denied traffic across your cloud network.

## Infrastructure & Storage

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Isolated network hosted on a public cloud.
- **Bucket**: Storage container for objects in cloud environments.
- **Instance**: A virtual machine in the cloud.
- **Region/Zone**: Geographical organization of data centers.

---

## Tools

- **Cloud Shell**: Browser-based command-line tool for managing GCP.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning cloud resources.
- **IAM**: Identity and Access Management â€” controls who can do what in your cloud.
